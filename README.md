# stock-prediction-rnn-web-app
Project to predict stock prices with Recurrent Neural Network in TensorFlow with client input as web application (in Dash and Flask).

**04/14/2020**<br>
Explored Dash (Plotly) library to create simple dashboard to display candlestick graph of stock price up to a year. Includes open and close prices. Red indicates drop in price on the day, green indicates an increase in price.

To run the dash app, run in terminal the following:
```
python stock_dash.py
```


Then in the web browser address bar enter `localhost:8050` (where `8050` is the port number to run `stock_dash.py`.)
